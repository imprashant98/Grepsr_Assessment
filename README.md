1. Development Environment Setup:
● Select and configure an open-source LLM such as LLaMA 3, BERT, Vicuna or any other suitable alternative.
● Set up a development environment for API implementation using a framework like Flask or FastAPI.
2. API Implementation:
● Create an API endpoint that accepts an HTML block as input.
● Implement functionality within the API to utilize the chosen LLM for processing
the HTML content.
3. HTML Processing:
● Using ML, parse the HTML to identify and extract meaningful attributes relevant to e-commerce contexts (e.g., product names, prices, descriptions, images).
● Identify the CSS selectors or Xpaths for each extracted attribute to pinpoint their location within the HTML structure.
4. Data Formatting and Output:
● Format the extracted attributes and their respective selectors into a JSON structure.
● Ensure the API returns this JSON formatted data as a response to requests.
